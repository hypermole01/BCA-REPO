Here I am providing my own interview experience with SAP Labs in the month of September of 2025 on-campus for BCA undergraduate.

SAP takes all total 4 rounds to hire for Scholar program from BCA & BSC.

The 4 rounds includes:

Coding round
Tech round 1
Tech round 2
HR/ Managerial round
Coding Round
We had coding round on SHL platform where need to be solved 2 coding questions within 45 mins.

There were 2 easy coding questions including:

1. Count the chars which is not any arithmetic operators, symbols and vowels.

2. Count the number of occurrence of a given word.

I was shortlisted for Tech round-1 knowing me via email from SAP.

The Tech round 1 & 2 both were scheduled at a particular day from 9 am sharp.

After an introductory session at 8 am, the interview process began.

Tech Round – 1
At 10.15 am I was allowed to join a interview panel where initially after introduction of both side we began our discussions.
We had discussions about my projects(what is it, real life exp.). Then asked some questions on basic React JS, Node JS(As I am a MERN dev.). After we had discussions on OOPs majorly data encapsulation, abstraction, Inheritance, friend class & function, polymorphism etc. It had came to an end by a question from my side about the work and growth culture at SAP. It has been for 15 – 17 mins.

At 1.30 pm(nearly), I got email stating my eligibility for Tech round -2, I was happy.

Tech Round – 2
Nearly about 3 pm I was allowed to join a panel where the discussions began after the introduction of both side. I was asked only 3 questions in this round. First was based on inheritance & friend class. After that I was asked about the places where I have visited till date(As my area of interest is Travelling). Lastly a puzzle(Temple & magical pond) was asked to me and it last for only 18 – 20 mins. I was able to answer all of the questions. t had came to an end by a question from my side about the work and growth culture at SAP.

Nearly about 8 pm I was notified that I am eligible for the HR round, I was happy.

HR/ Managerial Round
It was scheduled after 1 day & log in time was 9 am sharp. At 9.40 am I was allocated a panel where we had discussions with the VT managers. She made me comfortable and then asked about my IOT based project and told me to give an innovative IOT idea. Then asked about my motivation to join SAP labs as a Scholar. After that some situational question(how to handle conflict, how you will convince a team member if he/she disagree with a tech stack which you know is best for the product ) was asked. And I was able to answer all confidently. Lastly our discussions came to an end after some questions from my side(I asked about the tech and domain currently SAP running).

Although we were supposed to get an email by 8 pm on the very day but we didn’t After 2 days 6 person from our college got the positive mail and I was one of them. I was Happy.

Key points to have during preparation/ interview
Always be yourself.
Prepare as much as you can(OOPs, DBMS, OS, CN & cutting edge techs)
Always be ready to take challenges during interview.
Be confident and keep a smile in face & DO NOT ACT OVERSMART.
Try to answer all questions without saying ‘I don’t know’.
Lesson from my side: I had appeared for SAP internship also on July but didn’t make it at that time but I got the job after 2 months. So FAILURE is not a bad thing but after failure not keep trying is very bad thing, so convert your failure to create a positive impact.
Thank you very much & Best of Luck !
